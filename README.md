# ML-mini-projects
Repository for experiments with technologies in ML. Well documented for those who want a place to begin or examples for reference. 

## Contents
|Directory|Description |
|----|-----------|
|Jupyter-Notebooks|Compilation of mini implementations of ML algorithms for learning purposes|
|Forest-Fire-Forecast|Mini Project for implementing first steps of ML Pipeline: data preprocessing, data segregation, algorithm selection and evaluation. Uses Forest Fire dataset.|
|Deriving Features| Directory with multiple notebooks on feature engineering basics for numerical and categorical features- goes more in depth of the ML pipeline step for data preparation & feature engineering|
|Pizza-ML| Directory with multiple notebooks implementing ML techniques from scratch on a Pizza dataset|
|Creating-ML-Models| Directory with multiple notebooks covering ML Algorithms and practices at a higher level, good overview on how to create ML models |
|Scikit-Learn-Building-Models | Directory that covers more in depth how to use scikit-learn to implement ML algorithms and work with various types of data|

## Purpose
The purpose of this repository is to be a reference point for those starting to learn ML - within directories projects reference resources and are well documented.
